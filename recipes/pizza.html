    </ul>

    <h2>Direction</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all the ingredients</li>
        <li>Make dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl; dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Mix in flour, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt until dough pulls away from the side of the bowl</li>
        <li>Turn onto a light floured surface. knead until smooth, about 8 minutes</li>
        <li>Place dough in a well oiled bowl and cover with damp cloth</li>
        <li>Set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down; knead in garlic and basil. Set aside to rise 1 more hour, or until doubled again</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make garlic oil: Combine 1/2 cup olive oil with minced garlic in a microwave-safe cup or bowl. Heat for 30 seconds in the microwave</li>
        <li>Preheat the grill for high heat; bruch the grate with garlic oil</li>
        <li>Make pizzas: Punch down the dough and divide in half. Form each half into an oblong shape 3/8 to 1/2 inch thick</li>
        <li>Carefully place the dough on the hot grill. Dough will begin to puff almost immediately. When the bottom crust has lightly browned, turn the dough over</li>
        <li>Immediately brush garlic oil over the crust</li>
        <li>Top with 1/2 of each of the following: Tomato sauce, chopped tomatoes, olives, red peppers. cheese, and basil</li>
        <li>Close the lid and cool until cheese melts. Remove the from the grill and set aside to cool for a few minutes. Repeat with the second piece of dough</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
